MagicInit is a Dagger Module that runs inference on your project and generates a relevant starter module. Go from 0 to pipeline with one command. 

It's not magic. It's Dagger.â„¢

# Usage 

Infer project and generate dagger pipeline.

```
dagger call magicinit --source . -o .dagger
```

# Sample Projects for Testing

Ruby -> https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon

# Future Improvements 
* be able to create the dir ourselves in the future 
* be able to specify which SDK you want to use 
* make Dagger version in template dagger.json be more intelligent
* add this to dagger init by default (will allow us to not have to include --source)
